2009-02-08: remove autoload away from ocp.ini (no need to have it there, since it will change for each version of OCP. OCP should know this statically, based on where it found libocp.so

2009-02-09: filesel/pfilesel.c: playlist now cover entire screen when selected. Pressing INSERT while in playlist now also works as expected

2009-02-11: binfile/*: removed support for ocp.pak. We only had one file left in it, and we don't bother if ocp spans of multiple files either any more (dlopen() is more easy to use when you don't use an archieve aswell)

2009-06-04: dev/mix.c: typecast pointers via long int, and not just uint32_t when you want to do shifting on them (even though other arcs not using x86  assembler inlines doesn't use the variables, but we still want it beeing sane)

2009-06-04: dev/player.*: Fixed issues regarding x86_64 (segfaulting). Mixing 64bit unsigned and 32bit signed variables doing simple + math can lead to undefined behaviour.

2009-06-04: playflac/flacplay.c: wrong footprint on a callback (visible on 64bit hosts)

2009-06-04: playit/itload.c playxm/xmload.c: (debug) printf format string warnings on 64 hosts fixed
