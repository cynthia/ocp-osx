Original authors of Cubic Player is the Cubic Team (www.cubic.org)
DOJ and Pascal really rocks on that kind of software, so all respect goes to
those guys who made this player.

Linux rewrite/porting is done by Stian Skjelstad (and hopefully a couple of
other people soon). The player itself is just rewritten to Linux, and assembler
stuff in wrapped into C instead of using external assembler. With time
C-replacers will be availble as a start for those who intend to port this
beyond to other architechures. Filehandling is more-or-less redone from
scratch, with the old one on my mind.

playay plugin is cut'n paste from the aylet project. Copyright holders here are
Russell Marks, Ian Collier and the MAME project.

playopl plugin contains some code from the original AdPlug project (which is
also links too). This code has been released under GPLv2 with the permission
from the original copyright holder, Simon Peter.
