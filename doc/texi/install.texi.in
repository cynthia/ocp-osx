@section Installation
Some UNIX variants allready have Open Cubic Player in their packaging systems.
If not, you are going to need to download the source and extract it.

@quotation
wget http://stian.lunafish.org/ocp/ocp-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.tar.bz2
tar xfz ocp-@PACKAGE_VERSION@.tar.bz2
@end quotation

Please make sure that you have development-packages of the following libraries
installed:

libmad
libsidplay 1.x
libvorbis / libogg
ncurses
Xlib
libXpm


To compile and install do the following

@quotation
cd ocp-@PACKAGE_VERSION@
./configure && make install
@end quotation

If configure complains about any-missing headers/libraries, please consule the
list above needed libraries.

@section Files
When OCP loads a module the information stored inside the file is read and
stored in a special file( the @emph{module information cache}.) Actually the
cache splits up into three files:
@itemize
@item
CPARCHS.DAT   Information about archives and files stored inside
@item
CONDZTAG.DAT  Paths to @file{.MDZ} files (see appendix @xref{mdz}.)
@item
CPMODNFO.DAT  Informations about various modules
@end itemize
If you delete these files all file information gathered is permanently lost.

The @file{doc} directory contains documentation files in various formats
and release notes etc. You can safely delete this directory if you are running
out of disk space.

@section OCP and ALSA (linux)
OCP doesn't support ALSA directly, since OCP is written for OSS which is
cross-platform. Please load @file{snd-pcm-oss} and @file{snd-mixer-oss}, to
provide a legacy OSS interface from ALSA.
