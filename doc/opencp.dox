.Forew Foreword
[Foreword]

  OpenCP is a music file player. It is derived from the Cubic Player 2.0appe
which was developed by Niklas Beisert. Currently Tammo Hinrichs is maintaining
OpenCP with help from Dirk Jagdmann and various other people. And a a new unix
fork has started to take form by Stian Skjelstad.

  OpenCP is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL). That means
you can use this software free for personal use only. The source code is
available to the public and everybody is encouraged to make changes to it.
Please send any modifications and bugfixes to the authors. The authors do
not take any warranty for any damages whatever kind produced by this software.
For further details see the file "COPYING.TXT".

  Official versions of OpenCP can be downloaded from our website,
http://www.cubic.org/player.

  Currently MS-DOS and Windows 95 are supported operating systems. A Linux
version is planned for the future. A graphical GUI when running under Windows
is in development too. Perhaps in the far future OpenCP can be ported to
standard C++ code to compile well under all native Unix environments. If you
are an experienced developer and would like to help us porting or improving
this software please contact the authors.

  ~Bugs~: If you encountered a bug in OpenCP please send a detailed bug report
to Tammo Hinrichs. Many people complain about music files not being played
properly (especially with module formats). Please keep in mind that the
original tracking/sequencing program is ~always~ the reference for correct
playback. If a music file sounds different compiled to another player, please
keep in mind that perhaps the other program does not play it correct. This is
espicially true for Amiga 4channel modules. As those files can be produced
using various trackers (Noise-, Sound-, Protracker and many, many more) and
sadly all of those trackers are slighty different, a general player like OpenCP
can not play ~all~ modules correctly. We try to come as close to a reasonable
mixture of them all, so that most modules are played correctly. However certain
features of one tracker permit another feature of a different tracker.

.Instfile Installation and Files
[Installation and Files]

  OpenCP needs no special install procedure. Simply copy all the files you
found inside the archive into one directory. If you like you can add this
directory to you path statement. Example:

  Install OpenCP into "C:\\OpenCP" by typing:

  ~C:~
  ~CD \\~
  ~MD OpenCP~
  ~CD OpenCP~
  ~PKUNZIP -D C:\\<theRightDirectory>OpenCP~

  Then you can modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT and add the new directory to the
path statement. The new path might look like

  ~PATH C:\\WINDOWS;C:\\WINDOWS\\COMMAND;C:\\OpenCP~

  The following files are (at least) required to start OpenCP:

  ~cp.exe~         the startup file used to start the OpenCP runtime system
  ~cp.ini~         the initialization file read by cp.exe to configure itself
  ~cp.pak~         the DLL library where all modules are stored

  As OpenCP is a Watcom program it normally needs the DOS4GW extender to use
protected mode. But DOS4GW has some minor bugs and is a huge program. The
file ~CPLAUNCH.EXE~ is an alternative dos extender started automatically by
OpenCP. You should include this file in the directory too.

  When OpenCP loads a module the information stored inside the file is read
and stored in a special file (the ~module information cache~). Actually the
cache splits up into three files:

  ~cparcs.dat~     Information about archives and files stored inside
  ~cpmdztag.dat~   ?
  ~cpmodnfo.dat~   Informations about various modules

  If you delete these files all file information gathered is permanently
lost.

  If you install third party plugins they will be located in the main directory
too and included into the OpenCP runtime system at startup.

  The "DOC" directory contains documentation files in various formats and
release notes etc. You can safely delete this directory if you are running
out of disk space.

  ~Footnotes:~

  It is possible to use DOS4GW instead of CPLAUNCH. Simply type "DOS4GW CP.EXE"
at the command prompt or delete the file "CPLAUNCH.EXE".

  {Contents,Back to contents page}
.TPPlugins Third party plugins
[Third party plugins]

  If you want to use a plugin simply copy it inside the home directory. OpenCP
will search the home directory for plugins each time it starts. If the plugin
is valid and compatible with the player it will be loaded and its features
enabled.

  {Contents,Get back to contents}
.StartOCP Starting OpenCP
[Starting OpenCP]

  After starting OpenCP from the command line the dos extender is loaded. By
default OpenCP looks for a file "CPLAUNCH.EXE" in the home directory. If it
can not find this file it will look for "DOS4GW.EXE" in all directories
included in the path statement. When none of these files are found OpenCP
exits with the error message "could not execute: No such file or directory".

  OpenCP then tries to detect the sound cards defined in the "CP.INI" file.
If the card is not found you can not use it. If more than one sound card is
installed and found by OpenCP the first one listed in the "CP.INI" is used
as the default device.

  By entering a filename as parameter onto the command line you can load a
module. If one file is given the module will be loaded and OpenCP starts with
the player.

  When the parameter is the name of a directory the fileselector starts with
the given directory. If the parameter equals a certain archive all files
found inside the archive will be played (by adding them to the playlist).

  If more than one parameter is given a playlist will be set up, containing
all found files. You can mix filenames of archives, files in archives and
normal files on the hard disk.

  You normally don't have to supply the right file extensions, as they are
guessed by the fileselector. If the filename is not complete the file will not
be processed (unlike the quickfind function).

  OpenCP can be configured using the command line, although the configuration
through the "CP.INI" file is more comfortable. The options split up into three
main sections each starting with "-" followed by a letter. For each section
different options are given, which will configure the player accordingly. You
can precede each option with the section prefix every time or supply multiple
options seperated with ",". Some special options do not require the use of a
sections prefix, like the ~help~ switch.

  The command line looks like:
  cp [prefix option[,option]] [specialOption] [filename]

  Special options include:

  -h           show a help screen
  -m           use a monochrome graphics card (hercules or mda). Useful when
               starting under Windows.
  -c<name>     use a configuration defined in "CP.INI"

  Fileselector options are envoked with ~-f~. The values in square brackets
define a choice that must be made when using one of these options.

  r[0|1]       remove played files from module list
  o[0|1]       don't scramble module list order
  l[0|1]       loop modules

  Playback options are preceded by ~-v~. Values in sharp brackets define a range
in which the value must be taken.

  a<0..800>    set amplification
  v<0..100>    set volume
  b<-100..100> set balance
  p<-100..100> set panning
  r<-100..100> set reverb
  c<-100..100> set chorus
  s[0|1]       set surround
  f[0|1|2]     set filter (0=off, 1=AOI, 2=FOI)

  Device settings are accomplished with the suffix ~-s~.

  p<name>      use specific player device
  s<name>      use specific sampler device
  w<name>      use specific wavetable device
  r<0..64000>  sample at specific rate
  8            play/sample/mix as 8bit
  m            play/sample/mix as mono

  Finally an example to illustrate the above features:

  cp -fl0,r1 -va80,p50,f2 -spdevdisk -sr44100 ftstar.xm

  This will start OpenCP and load the file "FTSTAR.XM". The music will be
played once and will not loop (-fl0,r1). Further the player is advised to
amplify this file with 80%, set the panning to 50% and interpolate every
sample (-va80,p50,f2). The mixed output will be saved into .WAV format through
the ~diskwriter~ device (-spdevdisk) with a sample rate of 44.1kHz (-sr44100).

  You can curn this .WAV file directly onto a CD-Audio and play it with every
normal CD-Player. A much simpler and more convinient way to make such a ~sample~
~image~ out of a module is by using predifined configurations with the -c
switch. Have a look at the section {UsingDW,Using the diskwriter}.

  {Contents,Up to the top!}
.Filesel Fileselector
[Fileselector]

  If OpenCP is started without any command line arguments the fileselector will
be loaded. With this powerful tool you can browse through modules and set up
playlists to be processed by the player. If you switch to the player the
selected files will be loaded and processed.

  Files can be stored inside compressed archives to save space on the hard disk.
Those files are automatically unpacked to a temporary directory before scanning/
loading. If you have many modules you should use this feature, as storing
modules inside archives is totally transparent when using the fileselector.

  {Contents,Back to contents}
.FSelMainSC Fileselector: main screen
[Main screen]

  The fileselector splits into three main windows: directory list, playlist
and module information as shown in figure 3.1.

  Figure 3.1: the fileselector screen

  <...insert screenshot here...>

  The path windows shows the current path and file mask. If you started OpenCP
from the home directory you will get the following: ~C:\\OPENCP\\*.*~ means that
the current directory is ~OPENCP~ on your ~C~ harddrive and all files are shown
(~*.*~). You can edit the path and the mask by pressing ~<Alt>+<Enter>~. After
editing the path press <Enter> to change to the appropriate directory. You can
edit the file mask to include only some files.

  "C:\\*.mod" will change to the root directory of hard disk ~C~ and show all
files ending with ~.mod~. The default setting should be the current directory
with a file mask ~*.*~ to show all files.

  The most important window is the directory list. Here you can see all files
in the current directory. If the extension is known to OpenCP the file
information will be shown in different colours depending on the file type.
Files not known to OpenCP will be shown in standard grey.

  At the most left side the file name provided by the operating system is
shown. The extension ~.???~ will specify the file type. (Note: by now OpenCP
has not checked if the file is ~really~ of that type. It is just assumed). If
you try to load a file with an extension that is not appropriate to the
filetype OpenCP will show an error message. The next row shows the title of the
file if the file type includes a title. In the third row the number of channels
is displayed. Finally rightmost the filesize is shown in bytes. If the module
is included in a ZIP archive the ~real~ file size is displayed.

  Right to the directory list you can see the play list. All files listed in
this window will be played, after you changed into the player. Entries in this
window are normally sorted alphabetically. So the order in this window must not
be the order in which files are loaded / played in the player.

  The window at the bottom is the module information. Many music format can
store general which is displayed here. If the file type does not support those
information you can edit the fields inside this window manually and OpenCP will
store the information for you.

  Finally at the very bottom is the quick find feature, which lets you easily
find files in the current directory.

  Goto next topic: "{FSelUse,Usage of the fileselector}"

  {Filesel,Back to "Fileselector"}
  {Contents,Back to Contents}
.FSelUse Usage of the fileselector
[Usage of the fileselector]

  The directory list shows you all files in the current directory which fit to
the file mask set in the path window. Under the alphabetically sorted files the
directories and drives are shown. Note: ~@:~ is a special drive which lets you
configure OpenCP without editing the ~CP.INI~ file.

  Use ~<>~ and ~<>~ keys to browse through the files. If you press ~<Enter>~ the
selected file will be loaded and played with the player. Pressing ~<Enter>~ while
selecting a directory or drive will switch to the selected item and the
directory will be read. ~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~, ~<Home>~ and ~<End>~ will work as
expected.

  If a module is played and you are in the player ~<F>~ will beam you to the
fileselector. When you have edited a playlist after playing the last song the
fileselector will be started automatically. You can always leave the file-
selector by pressing <Esc> twice! If no module is playing the program will
exit, while you will get back to the player if a module is played in the back-
ground.

  Playlists are shown in the playlist window at the right side of the screen.
The currently selected file is appended to the playlist by pressing ~<ÄÄ>~ or
~<Ins>~. ~<ÄÄ>~ or ~<Del>~ will remove it again. You can insert files multiple
times into the playlist by pressing the appropriate keys more than once. If
you have files in the playlist exit the fileselector by pressing ~<Esc>~! This
might sound confusing in the beginning, but you will notice the logic very
soon. In the player you start the next song in the Playlist by pressing
~<Enter>~.

  Normally you will start the fileselector from the player by pressing ~<F>~.
The current module will continue playing in the background. After you have
selected a file you have two choices:

  - ~<Enter>~ will stop the currently playing module and load the selected one.
    Then you will get back to the player. Use this key if you want to play the
    selected module immiediatly.
  - ~<Esc>~ will change to the player. Then you can start the next songs in the
    playlist by pressing ~<Enter>~. So you should insert the selected files
    into the playlist.

  All files in the current directory will be inserted into the playlist by
pressing ~<Ctrl>~+~<ÄÄ>~ or ~<Ctrl>~+~<Ins>~. The playlist will be deleted by
pressing ~<Ctrl>~+~<ÄÄ>~ or ~<Ctrl>~+~<Del>~.

  Although in the playlist window only the filename is shown, OpenCP stores
the complete path information. So you can insert files into the playlist from
totally different directories and drives. If files are inserted into the play-
list you can change to the playlist window by pressing ~<Tab>~. Inside the
playlist window all keys have full functionality. So you can load the selected
module immiediatly by pressing ~<Enter>~ or remove the list by pressing ~<ÄÄ>~.
If you are in the playlist window you can move the currently selected file by
pressing ~<Ctrl>~+~<>~ and ~<Ctrl>~+~<>~. This will affect the order in which
files are processed. ~<Ctrl>~+~\{<PgUp>, <PgDown>, <Home>, <End>\}~ work as expected.

  If many files are inside a directory selecting a module by the cursor keys can
be annoying, because it takes a long time to browse through the list. If you
know the filename you can start typing it on the keyboard. This enables the
quickfind feature. Characters already typed are shown in the quickfind window.
The current directory is searched for files matching the typed characters. Often
you don't have to type the complete filename, as it can be already determined by
the leading chars.

  At the bottom of the screen the fileinformation window is located. If the
file includes any additional information it will be shown at the appropriate
fields. You can edit each entry manually. (Note: all module information is read
by the fileselector once if it runs along this module the first time. The data
is stored in three files located in your home directory of OpenCP refered as the
~module information cache~. If the fileselector scans a directory and finds a
directory which has not been processed by the fileselector it may take some
minutes to read all file information out of the files and store them in the
module information cache).

  To switch to the module information window press ~<Shift>~+~<Tab>~. You can
use the cursor keys to select the entries. After pressing ~<Enter>~ the
information can be edited. When pressing ~<Enter>~ again the changes are stored
in the module information cache. Note: ~Do not change the entry "type" as the
file could not be loaded properly when the wrong filetype is entered! Normally
you never have to change this entry, except for old 15 instruments amiga
noisetracker modules!~

.FSelUseAdv Fileselector: Advanced usage
[Advanced Usage]

  The appearance and behaviour of the fileselector can be edited in the ~CP.INI~
(see also: {Config,Configuration}) file or by pressing ~<Alt>~+~<C>~. Changes made to the
~CP.INI~ are permanently, while configuration applied with ~<Alt>~+~<C>~ is only
valid while OpenCP is running.

  After pressing ~<Alt>~+~<C>~ you can toggle 13 options with keys <1>..<9> and
<A>...<D>. The following list will explain every option:

  1 - ~screen mode:~ you can change the screen mode for the fileselector. 80x25
      and 80x50 are standard screen modes and should be available on every VGA
      card. 80x30, 80x60, 132x25, 132x30, 132x50 and 132x60 are only available
      with a proper VESA BIOS installed.
  2 - ~scramble module list order:~ if this option is enabled the files inside
      the playlist will be played in random order. Otherwise the order shown in
      the fileselector from top to bottom will be used.
  3 - ~remove modules from playlist when played:~ normally you will want this
      enabled as modules are only played once. If you disable this option your
      playlist can be processed forever.
  4 - ~loop modules:~ if the music file ends it will start again. The next file
      will be played after pressing ~<Enter>~. If you turn off this option the
      playlist will play all modules without any user interaction.
  5 - ~scan module information:~ When entering a directory the files are process-
      ed to gather module information which can be shown. If you disable this
      option directories will be processed quicker.
  6 - ~scan module information files:~ the module information cache in the home
      directory of OpenCP will be read if this option is enabled.
  7 - ~scan archive contents:~ to save hard disk space you can store your files
      inside archives like .ARJ or .ZIP. If the fileselector finds an archive it
      will open it to scan for files.
  8 - ~scan module information in archives:~ if modules are found inside archives
      they will be decrunched to find any module information. This option can
      take several minutes if many modules are stored in archives.
  9 - ~save module information to disk:~ toggles wether to save gathered info
      in the module information cache.
  A - ~edit window:~ If you don't want the module information window at the
      bottom disable this option. The directory and playlist windows will
      stretch over the complete screen.
  B - ~module type colours:~ different file types are shown in different colours
      on the screen. When watched on monochrome monitors or laptops you might
      want to disable this option.
  C - ~module information display mode:~ changes the contents of the directory
      window. You can also use ~<Alt>~+\{~<I>~,~<Tab>~\} inside the fileselector.
  D - ~put archives:~ Show archives, so they can be accessed like directories.
      Normally this should be disabled if archives are scanned automatically.

  The screen size can be changed by pressing ~<Alt>~+~<Z>~. In 132 columns mode
some additional module information can be shown in the directory window. If the
fileselector is busy scanning the directory for files, you can interrupt the
scanning with ~<Alt>~+~<S>~.

  You can delete a file with ~<Alt>~+~<K>~. You will be prompted if you really want
to delete this file. When pressing ~<Y>~ the file will be deleted. If the file is
stored inside an archive the file will be deleted from the archive. (Note: If
only one file was stored inside a ~.ZIP~ archive PKZIP will leave an empty archive
of 22 bytes on you harddisk. See section {Config,Configuration} on how to avoid this).
The current file can be moved by ~<Alt>~+~<m>~. You will have to type the new path
in the path window into which the file will be moved. If the file is inside an
archive it will be extracted. You can specify an existing ~.ARJ~ file and the file
will be packed into the archive.

  The module information shown in the module information window can be saved to
a portable ASCII file. You may want this feature if you are a composer of music
and want to trade your music together with already processed module information
files. Start the fileselector and edit the information for the file. Then switch
back to the directory window and press ~<Alt>~+~<W>~. The fileselector will save
a file with the extension ~.MDZ~ and the filename of the selected file, which
stores all module information seen in the module information window. If a
directory is scanned and the fileselector finds such ~.MDZ~ files they will be
read and processed. The module information for all files in the current
directory can be saved with ~<Alt>~+~<A>~. You have to type the filename manually
in the path window without extension!

  You may want to change the entry ~type~ in the module information window if you
have old amiga modules or a non-standard MIDI file. Very old Noise- and Sound-
Tracker modules only had 15 instruments and no file identification. So the file-
selector is not able to detect those files and refuses to play them. You have to
insert ~M15~ in the ~type~ entry. If the module does not differ between tempo and
speed and is one of the 15 instrument type insert ~M15t~. Some ProTracker modules
do not differ between tempo and speed to. If you have one of those modules use
~MODt~. A module player for PC called DMP introduced a feature called panning. To
enable this (non-standard) feature insert ~MODd~. If you want to play MIDI files
with a second drum track on channel 16 use the ~MIDd~ option. Any other files
should be autodetected correctly. (If you have renamed a module to a different
extension, say ~hello.mod~ to ~hello.s3m~, OpenCP will refuse to play it, because
the file type is wrong. You could correct this by inserting the right file type
in the module information as shown above. But it is better to rename the file to
the right extension than tweaking the autodetection of the player.

  The current playlist can be saved into .PLS format by pressing ~<Alt>~+~<p>~. You
have to type the filename without extension in the path window. A standard
extension ~.PLS~ is appended. The playlist can be loaded just like any other
module from the fileselector or at startup.

  The drive ~@:~ is a special device which can be used to change the hardware
configuration without leaving the player. If you access this drive you will see
two subdirectories.

  In the ~INPUTS~ subdirectory you can choose the device which will be used when
sampling form external sources (when playing CD audio tracks or starting OpenCP
in sample mode). The ~DEVICES~ directory displays all devices which were detected
at startup. Normally you might want to change this if you want to save the next
file as a ~.WAV~ or ~.MP3~ file to the harddisk. If you have a soundcard with
hardware mixing support (Gravis, AWE, EWS) you can disable softwaremixing.

  If you are the lucky owner of a soundcard capable of hardware sample playing
you only have limited sample memory. If the sample data of the music is larger
than the available RAM OpenCP will try to reduce the sample size by applying the
following steps:

  1. Convert 16bit to 8bit samples. This is indicated by a "!" in the bit entry
     of the instrument section.
  2. Half the size of an 8bit sample. This is shown by a small «.
  3. Quarter the size of an 8bit sample, indicated by a ¬.

  Before ~downsampling~ the sample data OpenCP will search for the sample with
the lowest frequency spectrum. This sample will be converted first. If enough
space is freed up OpenCP will stop downsampling. If not the loader will continue
until the sample data fits into the sound card memory.

  The above behaviour can be avoided if a file is marked as ~big~ by pressing
~<Alt>~+~<B>~ in the fileselector. The filesize will turn red. Now a file will
not be loaded into the soundcard memory, but played with the internal mixing
routines. This limits the size of files only to the size of physical memory.

  When OpenCP is started with a valid filename the file is loaded and the player
interface is started. This is the main part of OpenCP and you have various ways
to display all kinds of music information and data.

  OpenCP display general (status) information in the first 4 rows. Some of these
entries can be changed by the user, others are static for each module. The
following list will explain every entry.

  ~vol~      The bar displays the current playback volume. The default value is
           100 and you can change it by pressing ~<+>~/~<->~ on the numeric keypad.
  ~srnd~     Toggle this option with ~<F4>~ to enable a simple surround effect.
  ~pan~      If a voice should be played on the right speaker you can rearrange
           the stereo panning with this entry and ~<F5>~,~<F6>~. To get mono sound
           adjust the two ~riders~ to the middle.
  ~bal~      Just like the device on your stereo this option works. Press ~<F7>~,
           ~<F8>~ to adjust the stereo balance between full left and full right.
  ~spd~      The playback speed can be changed with ~<F9>~,~<F10>~.
  ~ptch~     The pitch of the file can be altered with ~<F11>~,~<F12>~.
  ~row~      Most files of module type are devided into rows and patterns.
  ~row~      Most files of module type are device into rows and patterns. The
           1st number shows the currently played row. The 2nd number shows the
           total number of rows in the current pattern. All numbers are shown
           in hexadecimal format.
  ~ord~      Modules are devided into several orders consisting of patterns.
           The 1st number shows the currently played order. The 2nd number
           shows the total count of orders.
  ~tempo~    the current tempo of the file.
  ~bpm~      These are not the physical beats per minute, but rather the speed
           at which the file is played (only valid for module types). This
           option is often refered by Trackers as BPM.
  ~gvol~     Some file formats allow a global volume to be set.
  ~amp~      This option lets you adjust an amplification. You can adjust this
           value with ~<Ctrl>~+\{~<F2>~,~<F3>~\}.
  ~filter~   You can selected different types of interpolation by pressing
           ~<BackSp>~:

           ~off~ - no interpolation.
           ~AOI~ - OpenCP tries to determine if interpolation is really
                 necessary for each note and sample independently. This is the
                 default option and should be enabled.
           ~FOI~ - every sample is always interpolated. This option uses more
                 processor power than AOI.
  ~module~   shows the filename currently played and the title of the file.
  ~time~     time since starting the current file.

.PlayerGlob Player: Global functions
[Global functions]

  Below the general information is a dark grey line. On the left side of the
line the current screen mode is shown. In the middle is a list of channels. Each
file type has a maximum number of channels played simultaeniously. For example
simple file formats as ~.WAV~ can only have one or two channels (corresponding to
a mono or stereo sample). An audio CD always has 2 channels (left and right).
Module file types can have many channels typically ranging from 4 to 32
channels.

  The currently selected channel is displayed in light grey. To select another
channel use ~<ÄÄ>~, ~<ÄÄ>~. You can also use ~<>~, ~<>~ which will loop through the
channels if the left or right end is reached.

  Pressing ~<Q>~ will ~quiet~ the selected channel. This key is valid in every part
of the player. To enable the channel press ~<Q>~ a second time. The reverse logic
can be accomplished with ~<S>~. This disables all other channels than the
selected one, so this channel plays solo. Another hit on ~<S>~ will ~unsolo~ the
channel again, so playing all channels. You can use any combination of the above
keys. An example: Select channel 1 and press ~<S>~. Now you will hear only channel
1. Now select channel 3 with the cursor keys and press ~<Q>~. As the channel
currently is turned off, it will be played again, so you hear channels 1 and 3.
Then switch to channel 2 and press ~<S>~. Now only channel 2 is played, channels
1 and 3 are turned off again. By pressing ~<S>~ again all channels are enabled.

  You can directly ~solo~ the first channels by pressing keys ~<1>~..~<0>~. This
will act as if you had changed to the appropriate channel and pressed ~<S>~.
Channels 11-20 are accessed throught ~<Alt>~+\{~<1>~..~<0>~\}.

  To pause playback press ~<P>~.

  The current file can be restarted by pressing ~<Ctrl>~+~<Home>~. To move a bit
forward use ~<Ctrl>~+~<ÄÄ>~. If a module is played this will skip the current
order and start playing the next one. In other file types this command skips a
certain amount of time, depending on the estimated playing time. ~<Ctrl>~+~<ÄÄ>~
will rewind the music. This is not possible for all file types (MIDI or SID
files). When playing modules the current order is skipped and the previous one
is played from the beginning. To skip a smaller amout of the file use ~<Ctrl>~+~<>~
and ~<Ctrl>~+~<>~. This will skip 8 rows when playing modules. If the files
support jump or loop commands using these functions can lead you to patterns not
included in the original play order! Be aware that using these functions can
lead to somewhat crashed files.

  The next file in the playlist can be loaded with ~<Enter>~. If no more files are
left in the playlist the fileselector will be started so you can choose the next
files. However the current module will continue playing. By pressing ~<Esc>~ you
can switch back to the player again. The fileselector can also be invoked with
~<F>~. The current playlist is shown and can be edited. When exiting the file-
selector with ~<Esc>~ you can load the next module in the playlist with ~<Enter>~.
Leaving the fileselector with ~<Enter>~ will load the currently selected module
and switch back to the player.

  By default a module is looped after its end was reached. You can change this
behaviour by configuring the fileselector or with ~<Ctrl>~+~<L>~. When looping
is disabled the next module in the playlist will be loaded once a module has
ended. If no modules are left in the playlist the fileselector is started.

  A DOS-Shell will be started when typing ~<D>~. Note that OpenCP uses about 200KB
of conventional DOS memory so not all programs might start or execute properly.
However it should be enough to do simple tasks like copying, deleting etc. When
running under Windows95 the free amount of memory should be the usual size.

  The screen mode can be changed by pressing ~<Z>~. This will toggle between 25
and 50 rows textmode, while ~<Ctrl>~+~<Z>~ toggles between 30 and 60 rows textmode.
~<Alt>~+~<Z>~ will toggle between 80 and 132 column mode.

  The current configuration can be "saved" with ~<Alt>~+~<F2>~. It is not stored
permanently on hard disk, but only valid until OpenCP is quit. Normally the
default configuration is loaded every time a new file is played. This function
makes the current configuration the new default configuration. A previously
saved configuration can be loaded with ~<Alt>~+~<F3>~. The ~real~ default values are
loaded with ~<Alt>~+~<F4>~. To modify the default values permanently you have to
change the ~CP.INI~ file as explained on page "{Config,Configuration}".

  If the ~diskwriter~ device has been prepared you can manually start the harddisk
sampling by pressing ~<Alt>~+~<S>~. See "{Config,Configuration}" for details on configuring
OpenCP.

  An online help is shown by ~<H>~, ~<?>~, ~<F1>~ or ~<!>~. You're currently
reading it. ~Note~: The ~<!>~ key was introduced in this help browser because
at the moment I'm writing this the browser only is a plugin. The standard help
is registered first and so will be processed first, so I had to add a new key.

  Users of SoundBlaster AWE, Terratec EWS or Gravis Ultrasound can use
~<Ctrl>~+~<F5>~ and ~<Ctrl>~+~<F6>~ to adjust the onboard reverb effect. The SBAWE
can also add a chorus effect which is controlled via ~<Ctrl>~+~<F7>~ and
~<Ctrl>~+~<F8>~.

.PlayerText Player: Text mode functions
[Text mode functions]

  The player has two different operating modes. Text mode and graphics mode. In
text mode you can enable various functions at once, while in graphics mode only
one single function can be shown.

  Because there can be more than one text mode function visible at the same time
you might have to press the according key more than once to get the wanted
effect. Each function can be in one of the following states:

  - invisible/inactive
  - invisible/active
  - visible/inactive
  - visible/active

  When pressing a key the according function is made active, but left invisible.
By pressing the same key a second time the function will be made visible. An
active function can be recognized by their title string displayed in bright
blue, while inactive functions have their title string displayed in dark blue.
Keys affecting the functions are only processed for the currently active mode.
So it might be necessary to change to the appropriate mode by pressing its key
once to manipulate its behaviour.

  The textmode functions divide the screen into fields shown in figure 4.2.

  Figure 4.2: screen arrangements in 80 and 132 column text mode
  <as all screenshots or screenshot-like things this is not ready yet...>

  In the 132 column mode only one of the instruments* and channels* field is
active and used by the appropriate function. If a function is not visible the
space is used by the other visible functions.

.TXMChan Player: Text mode functions: Channels
[Channels text mode function]

  The channel function is invoked with ~<C>~. The channels appear in two different
modes. By default the short mode is enabled. Two channels are shown in one row.
A grey number shows the selected channel. Left to it a white number shows the
currently played instrument/sample on this channel followed by the note. If the
note starts to play it is displayed in cyan for a short while. The third number
shows the current volume at which the instrument/sample is played. Behind the
volume the current effect is shown. At the rightmost of each entry the current
real (physical) volume splitted among left and right output channel is displayed
in a bar graph.

  The currently selected channel is indicated by a small white "~>~" to the left
side of the channel number. When a channel is muted with ~<S>~ or ~<Q>~ it is shown
in dark grey. However OpenCP continues to play this channel, so that the music
sounds correctly when turning on this channel again.

  When pressing ~<C>~ twice the channel function switches to the long format. Each
channel now uses a single row as more information is being displayed. From left
to right this is as follows: channel number, instrument/sample name, current
note, instrument/sample volume, pan position, current volume.

  If the textmode is changed to 132 column mode the channel function can be
displayed in short form at the upper right corner of the free space as shown in
figure 4.2.

  If there are more channels than space inside the screen area OpenCP will
scroll automatically through the channel list when you use the cursor keys. This
is indicated by white ~~ and ~~ characters.

  The channel function has no title string which could indicate if it is active
or inactive. So you might have to press ~<C>~ one time more often if the channel
function was previously inactive.

.TXMInsts Player: Text mode functions: Instruments
[Instruments text mode function]

  If the current file is of module file type (or MIDI) the used instruments/
samples are shown with the instruments function. The instruments are shown
with ~<I>~. Just like channels instruments come in two formats, short and long.

  In the short view only the instrument names are shown giving you space for two
instruments for row in 80 column mode (4 instruments are shown in 132 column
mode). An instrument/sample that is currently played is shown in bright cyan. If
the sample is played on the currently selected channel it is shown in bright
green. All inactive instruments are drawn dark grey. If a sample has been
played once a rectangular dot is placed left to the instrument number.

  When the instruments are switched to long mode various information is
displayed. From left to right this is as follows:

  - a number from 00h to FFh giving the instrument number
  - instrument name
  - sample number (when using multiple samples per instrument)
  - sample name (only in 132 column mode)
  - length of the sample in bytes
  - length of the loop in bytes
  - bits per sample
  - the base note. For modules the default is ~C-4~
  - finetune value
  - standard volume at which the sample is played.
  - standard pan position
  - various flags (volume, pan envelopes etc.)
  - fadeout value (only in 132 column mode)

  Often a file includes more instruments than can be shown on the screen. Use
~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~ to scroll through the instruments. If the instrument function
is active ~<Ctrl>~+\{~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~\} will scroll for a complete page. When
inactive you can scroll single lines by using ~<Ctrl>~+\{~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~\}. This is
very useful if you have enabled more than one textmode function.

  The instrument flags (the rectangular dots left to the instrument number) are
cleared with ~<Alt>~+~<I>~. By pressing ~<Tab>~ you can toggle between the colour
mode and pure grey.

.TXMPatts Player: Text mode functions: Pattern view
[Pattern view text mode function]

  Modules are arranged in patterns. You can view these patterns with the pattern
view function invoked with ~<T>~. When enabling this function OpenCP tries to
display all channels at once using the best display possible. For modules using
few channels (<8) this default display is acceptable, but you might want to
change it when playing modules with many channels.

  The pattern is shown in different columns. At the leftmost the row number is
shown in hex. If the screen mode and pattern view allows the row number is shown
again at the right side of the screen. Then follow some fields for global
commands the module might contain. The biggest section of the screen is used by
the channel columns, each one displaying a single channel indicated by the
number on top of the column. Inside such a channel column various information
can be displayed depending on the amount of space available. You can see the
format of a channel column in the status line of the pattern view. The format of
the column can be changed by pressing ~<Tab>~. As there are many combinations of
screen mode, channels and formats I will not go into detail here.

  The number of channel rows displayed at once can be changed by pressing
~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~. Normally the pattern view will follow as it progresses. With
~<Space>~ the pattern view will stop. The current play position is now displayed
with a white ~~ char. You can now browse through the module with ~<PgUp>~,
~<PgDown>~. ~<Space>~ will enable the follow mode again, bringing the pattern
view to the current play position.

  The pattern view displays the different effects used in modules with different
colours. Green is used for effects affecting the pitch of the sample while blue
commands change the volume. Effects drawn in purple change the pan position. Red
colours indicate the manipulation of the timeslice effected with this samples.
Other effects are drawn white. (In the HTML documentation there now follows an
reference to the online help, but, unfortunately, this list is not included at
the moment... wait for next version of help where also screenshots will be
included).

.TXMAnalyze Player: Text mode functions: Spectrum Analyzer
[Spectrum Analyzer text mode function]

  The spectrum analyzer uses the fast fourier transform (FFT) to gather infor-
mation on the audio spectrum used in sample data. The analyzer is started with
~<A>~. This function splits the sound data into many ~bands~ of pure sine waves.
This is called the spectrum of the sample.

  The status bar of this function shows you the range each bar covers and the
highest frequency processed (the leftmost bar corresponds to this frequency).
Use ~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~ to change the range. ~<Home>~ will set the default value
of 2756 Hertz.

  With ~<Alt>~+~<A>~ the mode of the spectrum function can be toggled. Stereo using
two analyzers, mono using only one and a solo mode are available. In the solo
mode the currently selected channel is used as sound source for the analyzer.

  ~<Tab>~ changes the colour used for the analyzer.

  To get a smooth view the default charset of the graphics adapter is modified.
This is working fine with every graphics card working under MS-DOS. However
Windows 95 does not allow the manipulation of characters, so the spectrum
analyzer function is not shown properly when running under Windows 95. If you
see a distorted screen while using the spectrum analyzer function under Windows
95 this is normal.

  The default graphics mode is 640x480x256. Only one graphics mode function can
be shown simultaneously. The screen therefore splits into the general window at
the top side showing the usual information and the function window covering the
rest of the screen. When running under Windows 95 the graphics mode can not be
displayed in a window. So there may be excessive mode switches if you switch
between graphics and textmodes, because windows will try to display the textmode
screen in a window. Use the full screen option of Windows 95 by pressing
~<Alt>~+~<Enter>~.

  If you have included a background picture in the ~CP.INI~ it will be shown
in the graphics modes (except the graphical spectrum analyzer and Wuerfel
mode).

logical (the channels are sorted with the default panning position), physical
(channels 1 to n from top to bottom), master (the mixed output channel(s)) and
single (the currently selected channel is shown).

  By pressing ~<Tab>~ you can enable/disable triggering of the scopes. If the
output is triggered a wave on the screen always starts with the upper halfwave.
If triggering is turned off the wave will be drawn from the current position.

  The scale of the scopes can be altered with ~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~.

the left side. High notes appear on the right side of the screen. By pressing
~<PgUp>~, ~<PgDown>~ the scale of the rows can be changed. However the default
scale fits the usual note scale of modules exactly, so there should be no need
to change.

  By pressing ~<N>~ you can alter the output appearance of the dots. In the modes
~stereo note cones~ and ~stereo note dots~ the current pan position is indicated by
the left/right half of the icon.

.GRMAnalyze Player: Graphic mode functions: Graphical spectrum analyzer
[Graphical spectrum analyzer graphic mode function]

  The graphical spectrum function works in two video modes. By pressing ~<G>~ you
will see the standard 640x480 mode. ~<Shift>~+~<G>~ will start the spectrum in
1024x768 mode. Apart from this difference the two video modes are equal.

  Pressing ~<G>~ more than once will toggle between the usual stereo, mono and
single channel mode for calculating and showing the spectrum. ~<PgUp>~ and
~<PgDown>~ adjust the frequency range. ~<Home>~ will set the frequency to 2756 Hz.
To half the resolution (and so speed up the calculation) press ~<Alt>~+~<G>~.

  ~<Tab>~ changes the palette of the graphical spectrum. ~<Shift>~+~<Tab>~ will do the
same for the standard spectrum analyzer at the bottom.

  If you have difficulties interpreting this function here is a short expla-
nation: The standard spectrum analyzer at the bottom shows you the current
frequency spectrum. The higher a single bar, the louder the frequency. Now
imagine looking at this spectrum from top, so every bar becomes a single dot.
The height of the bar is now coded with different colours (from black  low to
yellow  high). Now we can draw these points along the screen and see the
spectrum as it progresses over time. This is somewhat a "3D" view of the
spectrum, with the frequency coded along the y-axis, intensity coded in
different colours and the time along the x-axis.

.MidiFile MIDI files
[MIDI files]

  OpenCP is able to play MIDI files. However there is a certain problem. Unlike
the other formats MIDI does not store the sample information needed to produce a
sound output. The MIDI file only contains which instrument out of a set of 127
should play which note at a given time. This is the reason why ~.MID~ files are
much smaller than other file types.

  This has of course some disadvantages. To hear a MIDI file you need to have
some information about how to play the used instruments. Back in the old days
the OPL2 sound chip which was present on the SoundBlaster cards was used to play
the MIDI instruments. Most people find the sound capabilities of the OPL series
rather limited and MIDI files were no big deal back then.

  Things changed when so-called wavetable cards became popular. Those cards have
sample data stored onboard in a ROM plus a hardware mixer capable of mixing
several MIDI channels. The MPU-401 interface from Roland is the de facto
standard for accessing those cards, but this features is not supported by OpenCP
yet. A disadvantage is that those wavetable cards only have a very limited
memory for sample data, typically 4 MB. If you imagine 127 instruments and 64
drums fitting into just 4 MB you can guess what sound quality these cards have.
Modern cards have normally much more onboard ROM/RAM, but in our opinion even 32
MB are far to less for a good sound quality.

  OpenCP goes a different way. Instead of using the onboard ROM samples, the
samples needed for a specific ~.MID~ file are loaded on demand from the hard-
disk into main memory and then processed by either the hardware mixer (if you
have such a card and the samples fit into its memory) or by the software mixers.
This has the advantage that you can easily change a single instrument, if you
don't like the default sound and that only instruments are loaded (and therefore
memory needed) which are actually used by the file.

  At the moment two different formats for those MIDI patches are supported. Both
were introduced with the Gravis Ultrasound Cards. The older one using files with
the extension ~.PAT~ and a file describing the patch set ~DEFAULT.CFG~. With the GUS
PnP a new MIDI patch format was introduced using ~.FF~ files and a configuration
file called ~ULTRASND.INI~.

  To use those patch sets simply copy all files into one directory and use the
~ultradir~ option of the ~general~ section to point to the appropriate directory.
OpenCP will then process this file if a ~.MID~ file is selected and load the
defined patch sets.

  If you are not owning a Gravis Card you will have to get a patch set from our
homepage (or a different source) and install it in any directory. Note that most
patch sets are not public domain or freeware, so check out it you are allowed to
copy and use those samples.

.Config Configuration
[Configuration]

  OpenCP can be widely configured using the ~CP.INI~ file, which should reside in
the home directory of the player itself. This file is processed at every startup
and informs the player about various modules/plugins and their respective confi-
guration. For average users the default configuration should be sufficient.
However if you want to change certain aspects of the player permanently you have
to modify this file. You can use every ASCII editor to edit the INI file.

  The ~CP.INI~ consists of many sections. Each section starts with a section
identifier tag in square brackets \[\]. Examples of sections are ~\[general\]~ or
~\[sound\]~. The sections ID tag should be followed by a newline. After a section
has been declared with the ID tag the options describing the sections follow.
Each option takes a single line and consists of a keyword followed by a "=" and
the parameters. Example: ~mixrate=44100~.

  All options following a section ID are options for that section. If a new
section starts with an ID tag all forthcoming options are assigned to the new
section. All options for a section have to be grouped together. Multiple decla-
rations of sections are not valid.

  \[general\]
    link=dos4gfix
  \[defaultconfig\]
    link=mchasm
  \[general\]
    dos4gfix=off

  the above example has to be written as:

  \[general\]
    link=dos4gfix
    dos4gfix=off
  \[defaultconfig\]
    link=mchasm

  Note that in the above example the option ~link~ has not been overridden by the
~defaultconfig~ section. Both sections now can access an option named ~link~, but
both options are totally independent of each other.

  Comments can be placed anywhere in the configuration file and are marked by a
~;~. The rest of the line starting from the ~;~ is considered as a comment and not
processed.

  Normally the definition for an option ends with the end of the line. If many
parameters are needed to specify an option they may exceed the default line
width of 80 characters. Although this is no problem for OpenCP it is not nice
looking. You can extend a line logically by using the unix like ~backquote~ at
the end of a line to begin a new line without interrupting the current option
definition.

  \[example\]
    option1=parameter1 parameter2
    option2=parameter1 \\
            parameter2

  Both optains contain exactly the same parameters.

  When modifying the configuration you should always start with the default
configuration file and configure it to your needs. Building a bug free config
file from scratch is difficult.

  We will now have a look at the individual section and their options.

    ~This section contains...~

.ConfigGen Configuration: general
[Configuration: general]

  The ~general~ section describes which internal modules or plugins to load at
startup. Most of them are required for normal operation of OpenCP so you should
not remove any of the contents. All options in this section are loaded every
time OpenCP starts! The default ~general~ section looks like:

  \[general\]
    link=dos4gfix mmcmphlp poutput hardware pfilesel cpiface fstypes
    ultradir=c:\sys\iw
    dos4gfix=off
    ;datapath=
    ;tempdir=

  ~link~             this option describes the modules to load when starting
                   OpenCP. There is no need to change this option, unless you
                   have coded a basic internal module.
  ~ultradir~         If you want to hear MIDI music you need samples for the
                   general MIDI instrument set.
  ~dos4gfix~         DOS4GW is a protected mode extender used by the Watcom C++
                   compiler. However this extender has problems with IRQs
                   greater than 7. If you use the default dos extender ~CPLAUNCH~
                   you should disable this option. If you want to use DOS4GW for
                   whatever reason and your soundcard uses an IRQ greater than 7
                   you have to enable this.
  ~datapath~         OpenCP searches for background pictures and animations in its
                   home directory. If you want to store your artwork at a
                   different place use this option to set the right directory.
  ~tempdir~          this directory is used for extracting modules from archives.
                   If you have set a DOS environment variable called either ~TEMP~
                   or ~TMP~ these will be used.

  ~link~             just like in the ~general~ section this option defines which
                   modules should be loaded at startup. You can delete some
                   entries if you will not need them - however this is not
                   recommended as they do not use much memory and do not require
                   any processor power when they are not used.
  ~prelink~          these files will be loaded before starting the main module.

  ~playerdevices~    OpenCP uses three different devices to communicate with the
                   hardware. The ~playerdevices~ are used to play a stream of
                   samples. As all sound cards support this feature you will
                   find ~playerdevices~ for every soundcard supported by OpenCP.
                   This device is needed for playing ~.WAV~ and ~.MP3~ files and if
                   you want/have to use the software (quality) mixer. OpenCP
                   searches for all devices listed in this option at startup and
                   only those found are actually loaded. You can delete all
                   devices you do not have installed to speed up the startup
                   procedure. If you have multiple sound cards installed be sure
                   to list all devices if you want to use more than one sound
                   card.
  ~samplerdevices~   these devices are the least important ones. They are only
                   needed if you want to use OpenCP when playing CD Audio tracks
                   or start the player in sample mode. The sample data is not
                   calculated from files, but sampled from either the CD, line
                   or microphone jack of the sound card. You can then use the
                   graphical screens to view the sounds.
  ~wavetabledevices~ for mixing several channels you have to use ~wavetabledevices~.
                   Most sound cards are only able to play two channels
                   simultaneously normally assigned to the left and right chan-
                   nel or your home stereo. The ~mixer~ devices are used to mix
                   the sample data of module files to those two channels. How-
                   ever modern sound cards have special hardware to mix channels
                   "onboard". But all hardware mixers have a maximum amount of
                   channels to mix. Especially ~.IT~ files often use more than 32
                   channels so an errorfree playback can not be guaranteed when
                   using hardware mixing. You should include one of the software
                   mixers for this case.
  ~ampegtomono~      play ~.MP3~ files only mono. This might be necessary if you
                   don't have the latest generation of Intel processors.
  ~ampegmaxrate~     the highest playback sample rate to use for ~.MP3~ files.
  ~mixrate~          the default mixrate. Unless you have a very old sound card or
                   a very old processor there is no need to change this option.
  ~mixprocrate~      if you have a slow CPU you might not to be able to play 32
                   channels at full mixrate. This value defines the maximum
                   "calculation power" to which OpenCP tries to use the full
                   mixrate.
  ~mix16bit~         Leave this option enabled unless you have a 8bit sound card.
  ~mixstereo~        dito for stereo cards
  ~plrbufsize~       When using a ~playerdevice~ to play sample streams a DMA
                   buffer is used to minimize CPU resources for handling the
                   sample stream. This option sets the DMA buffer length in
                   milliseconds.
  ~mixbufsize~       When running OpenCP in a multitasking environment there is
                   no guarantee for constant CPU resources. To avoid a break in
                   the sample stream OpenCP will calculate in advance. This
                   option sets the buffer length in milliseconds.
  ~samprate~         When using a ~samplerdevice~ this value will be used.
  ~samp16bit~        dito
  ~sampstereo~       dito
  ~smpbufsize~       this option sets the length of the sample DMA buffer in
                   milliseconds.
  ~defplayer~        with this option you can override the default ~playerdevice~.
                   Normally you don't need to set this option, as the default
                   device can also be set by order in the ~playerdevice~ option.
                   This option can also be specified by using the ~-sp~ options
                   from command line.
  ~defwavetable~     this option sets the default ~wavetabledevice~. Can also be set
                   with ~-sw~ command.
  ~defsampler~       the same as the ~-ss~ command line option.
  ~midichan~         unlike the module file types the MIDI file format does not
                   specify the exact amount of channels to use. Complex ~.MID~
                   files can easily try to play several dozens of channels
                   simultaneously. This option sets the maximum number of
                   channels to mix when playing ~.MID~ files. Note that this value
                   has no effect when a hardware mixing device is used, as the
                   maximum number is limited by the hardware.
  ~itchan~           the ~.IT~ format can play more than one sample per channel
                   simultaneously. A maximum number of channels to mix is
                   required for this file type too. When playing ~.IT~ files using
                   a hardware mixer the maximum number of channels is again
                   limited by the hardware.
  ~cdsamplelinein~   If you select a ~.CDA~ file the CD Input of your sound card
                   is used to sample the current music. If you do not have a CD
                   input or if you have connected your CD-ROM to the line-in
                   jack enable this option to change to sample input.
  ~bigmodules~       This option is of interest for users of hardware mixing
                   devices only. Sound cards capable of mixing channels are not
                   only limited by the amount of channels played simultaneously,
                   but by the amount of onboard memory to store the sample data
                   too. If files are marked as "big" in the fileselector the
                   device listed in this option will be used for mixing this
                   module.
  ~wavetostereo~     When playing a mono wave the sound card can either be
                   switched to mono mode or the wave can be played as a stereo
                   file.
  ~waveratetolerance~ if the sample rate of the wave file is not equal to a
                   sample rate supported by your sound card, OpenCP will not
                   resample unless this value is exceeded. Divide the value
                   by 1000 to get the percentage.
  ~amplify~          the default amplification to use within the player. The
                   following options are described in "{PlayerGen,Player: General}" in
                   detail. The command line option ~-va~ overrides this option.
  ~panning~          the default panning (command ~-vp~)
  ~volume~           the default volume (comand ~-vv~)
  ~balance~          the default balance (command ~-vb~)
  ~reverb~           some sound cards have a onboard effect processor which
                   features a reverb effect. This option controls the intensity
                   of the onboard effect. (command ~-vr~)
  ~chorus~           dito as reverb (command ~-vc~)
  ~surround~         this option controls the fake surround effect (command ~-vs~)
  ~filter~           The software mixer can use a software filter to enhance the
                   playback quality. Different algorithms can be used. (command
                   ~-vf~)

                   ~0~  no filter
                   ~1~  AOI - only filter samples when filtering is necessary
                   ~2~  FOI - filter every sample even if filtering has no effect

  ~usepics~          When using graphics modes you can use a picture to show in
                   the background. OpenCP will load any TGA files with 640x384
                   pixels and 256 colours. As the TGA format is poorly implemen-
                   ted in modern graphic programs this might change in the
                   future. As some colours out of 256 are used by OpenCP you
                   should leave either the first or the last 16 colours in the
                   palette black. The pictures should be copied to the home
                   directory of OpenCP, unless you specify a different location
                   in the ~defaultconfig~ section.
  ~compomode~        this option will enable the compo mode. The page
                   "{UsingCM,Using the compomode}" describes the details.
  ~startupmode~      start the player in either text or graphic mode. Valid

[Configuration: device configuration]

  The following sections define the various devices for the player. Unless you
really know what to do you should not change the following options. As most
entries are similar only some educational examples are listed here. For a
complete reference have a look at your personal ~CP.INI~ file for details.

  The general form of a device looks like:

  \[handle\]
    link=...
    subtype=...
    port=...
    port2=...
    irq=...
    irq2=...
    dma=...
    dma2=...
    bypass=...
    keep=...

  ~handle~           The internal name to use within the player. The ~CP.INI~ file
                   must contain all ~handles~ listed in the devices options of the
                   ~devices~ section.
  ~link~             the name of the DLL function this device will be linked to.
  ~port(2)~          the primary/secondary port of the sound card. This value has
                   to be given in hexadecimal with preceeding ~0x~ or appending ~h~!
  ~irq(2)~           the primary/secondary IRQ of the sound card
  ~dma(2)~           the primary/secondary DMA of the sound card
  ~bypass~           skip the autodetection if it may encounter problems
  ~keep~             keep the driver resident in memory, even it is not currently
                   needed. This will save some time by needing some memory.

  Most device functions of the standard DLL contain autodetection routines for
the supported sound cards, so there is normally no need to specify any of the
port, IRQ or DMA options. However if OpenCP is not able to detect your sound
cards settings you can try to insert the appropriate values in the configuration
file.

  The next subsections will look at the special features the different sound
cards and drivers support. The original order of the ~CP.INI~ has been slightly
modified for the purpose of documentation.

                   switched. To get the right order enable this option.
  ~subtype~          if your card is not properly detected (this can happen when
                   clones are not 100% compatible) you can set the type of card

  When starting OpenCP in a Windows 95 DOS-Box those settings will not work,

                   options to set it:

  The Gravis Ultrasound series devides into two subseries. The old standard
includes the Gravis Ultrasound (with daughterboard), Gravis Ultrasound Max and
Gravis Ultrasound ACE which use the old GF1 chip for hardware mixing. The new
Gravis Ultrasound PnP uses the AMD Interwave chip for hardware playback.

  \[devwGUS\]
    link=devwGUS
    gusFastUpload=on
    gusGUSTimer=on

  ~gusFastUpload~    use a non-standard feature to upload the sample data to
                   the fast RAM. If you experience problems with corrupted
                   playback, or if your system locks when loading a file disable
                   this option.
  ~gusGUSTimer~      use the internal GUS Timer for looping and synchronization.
                   This enables more precise playback, but may cause problems.

  If you own two GUS cards of the old series you can use a special feature of
OpenCP using both sound cards to enable quadruple or 3D playback.

  \[devwDGUS\]
    link=devwDGUS
  ; port2=250
  ; subtype=

  ~port2~            the base port of the secondary GUS, if it was not
                   autodetected.
  ~subtype~          you can specify how OpenCP will use the second GUS:

                     ~0~  the second GUS will play the rear stereo channels.
                        This is true quadrophony. Of course you have to have a
                        second stereo and a second pair of boxes.
                     ~1~  this will enable 3D playback. The additional boxes have
                        to be placed exactly behind the audience, one on the
                        floor and the other at the ceiling.

  OpenCP will still use the panning information provided by the music files and
place the channels randomly in the remaining dimensions. If you have access to
a second GUS be sure to check this feature one day, as the sound experience is
really amazing.

  For users of the new GUS PnP with the Interwave chip the following section is
relevant.

  \[devwIW\]
    link=devwIW
    iwIWTimer=off
    iwEffects=on
    iwForceEffects=off

  ~iwIWTimer~        use the internal sound card timer for synchronization. When
                   using OpenCP under DOS there is no need to use this feature.
                   However if you want to use the player under Windows 95 you
                   should enable this to prevent timer inconsenties from
                   Windows.
  ~iwEffects~        enable the onboard effects (reverb). This feature uses 64 KB
                   of the soundcard memory and 4 channels. So the maximum amount
                   of channels is reduced to 28. If the music uses more channels
                   OpenCP will turn off the effect to use the last channels or
                   memory.
  ~iwForceEffects~   if you enable this option the effects will always be present,
                   thus overriding the above option.

  By default OpenCP will use its own routines for mixing several channels to the
two stereo output channels. You have the choice between two mixers. The normal
mixer is faster in calculating, thus can mix more channels at the same time. The
quality mixer however produces better sound output. For average modules and a
pentium processor the quality mixer should be fast enough for sufficient play-
back. If many channels are used you may have to change back to the normal mixer.

  Both mixers take identical options. As the mixers will be rewritten in the
future the options are likely to change. Therefore they are not documented here.
Please have a look at future versions of this document if you want to change the
mixer settings. However these devices never have caused any trouble and there
should be no need for change.

.CArcs Configuration: archivers
[Configuration: archivers]

  When processing files inside archives OpenCP has to know how to call the
programs. The following sections define the usage of different archivers
supported by the OpenCP fileselector.

  ~%%~     evaluates to "%"
  ~%a~     evaluates to the archive name preceeded by the path to process.
  ~%n~     evaluates to the filename of the file to process inside the archive.
  ~%d~     evaluates to the destination directory used to extract files out of
         archive.

  Three default commands are defined for the archive modules:

  ~get~    this command is used when a file should be extracted out of an archive.
  ~put~    if a file should be added to the archive this command line is used.
  ~delete~ with ~<Alt>~+~<K>~ you can delete files out of archives.

  \[arcZIP\]
    get=pkunzip %a %d %n
    put=pkzip %a %n
    delete=pkzip -d %a %n
    deleteempty=on

  ~deleteempty~      the program PKZIP/PKUNZIP used by OpenCP to process ~.ZIP~
                   files have a bug when deleting the last file inside an
                   archive. An empty archive of 22 bytes is left on the hard
                   disk. With this option enabled the fileselector will delete
                   those "zip zombies".

  \[arcACE\]
    get=ace32 e %a %n %d
    scaninsolid=false

  ~scaninsolid~      ?

                   (Remark: I think this option disables scanning in solid ACE
                   archives, because it takes much time)

  The capatibilities of OpenCP can be extended by plugins. The type of plugin is
not limited, so new graphics modes, file types and even enhanced players may be
added by the user. As development for OpenCP is done using Watcom C++ 11.0 it is
recommended to use this compiler for developing plugins aswell. We have not
tested the plugin interface with other compilers. (This might change in the
future).

  If there are questions, don't hesitate to contact the authors. You may also
ask me for simple problems (like: why CP just flickers instead of switching to
my brand new ultra-cool interface mode? Or: What the heck means 'W?cpiTrkSetup$\\
n(rnx$cpitrakdisplaystruct$$i)v'?). My mail address is gfabian@jdcs.su.nw.schul\\
e.de. (A \\ means a word is continued in next line without a space).

.License License
~[GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE]~
~[Version 2, June 1991]~

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

~[Preamble]~

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the soft-
ware is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of
the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

~[GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE]~
~[TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION]~

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or trans-
lated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appro-
priately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringe-
ment or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are im-
posed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your ob-
ligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a con-
sequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distri-
bution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any parti-
cular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distri-
buted through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system;
it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a con-
sequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geograph-
ical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Pro-
gram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for per-
mission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

~[NO WARRANTY]~

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFOR-
MANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
