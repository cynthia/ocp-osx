If you hit a crashbug (and you have compiled yourself from source):

Go back into the source directory, and rerun configure with the same options
and settings, just add --with-debug:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-debug

The force rebuild everything again and install (cflags changes isn't detected
by make)

make clean all install

The run ocp again, and let it crash.. This time, ocp should automatically
enter gdb. Now, run bt.. (and maybe other commands if you are in contact with
me). This is the stuff I want sent to me (along with config.log from the
source tree).

(gdb) bt
#1 123123
#2 123123
#3 32131


In order to make ocp quit, simply tell gdb to quit.

(gdb) quit
